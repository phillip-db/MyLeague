## myLeague (tentative name)

For my final project, I want to work with the Riot Games/League of Legends API to collect information about a given
player/champion and display it in an interface using Cinder. I would like to give the user the ability to input a player
name/champion through a search bar UI element and select which statistics they would like to see.

Link to API and documentation: https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol

Previously in Java, I have worked with APIs, and I have experience in filtering/analyzing information from the JSON
assignment.

From the ideal gases project, I have experience in manipulating the cinder application to display different shapes/text.

I am interested in this project because I often play League of Legends, but the official, built-in stats are difficult
to navigate to, only display your stats, and are not visually appealing. Being able to access stats at any time about
myself, my friends, or various champions would be helpful when I play the game. Completing this project would be
beneficial for myself and my friends because it would be used often.

### Week One

* Investigate the Riot Games API, obtain a developer key
* Ensure that I am able to make various calls to the API
* Implement basic user input through (preferably) Cinder, console if necessary
* Parse user input for valid champion or player name

### Week Two

* Create classes to represent players, champions, and storage of stats
* Implement calls to the API that are used after searches to create/store values in classes
  * Ensure that calls are able to accept champion/player names passed in as parameter
* Implement various filtering and/or analysis functions for player and champion statistics

### Week Three 

* Display statistics using Cinder
* Play around with the looks/design of the application to be visually pleasing
* Provide buttons/menus/keyboard events to trigger the analysis/filter functions
* Provide search bar for champion/player names(connect backend search function with frontend UI element)

### Stretch Goals

If I have extra time, I would like to implement the ability for the user to customize how the application displays the
statistics. I could also implement the ability to search for and compare the statistics of multiple players at once. I
would also be interested in finding a way to resize aspects of the application based on display size.
